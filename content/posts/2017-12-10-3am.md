Baba, you cry, at 3am, \
I wake up, groggy, \
stumble through the dark, \
struggle to find my slippers in the rush, \
Baba, you cry, again

I hold you, hug you tight, \
you mumble, describe your nightmare, incomprehensibly,

I tell you it's going to be alright, \
Everything's going to be alright, \
I am here.

You calm down, \
ready to face Sher khan again, \
go back to sleep, \
in my arms.

I lay you down gently, \
kiss your forehead, \
smile inwards, \
at your face of pure innocence.

I sleep a little less, \
my heart melts a little more.
