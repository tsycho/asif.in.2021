Peacefully, you sleep, \
Innocent, carefree, \
Dreaming, \
You sigh, softly, \
You sleep, peacefully.

The days fly by, \
Lifeâ€™s stresses pile on, \
A deadline here, \
More stratagems there, \
I rush to face them all, \
You grow up, \
As the days fly by.

Sometimes I get annoyed, \
At my disrupted focus, \
At all the things I may not have done anyway, \
But now have a reason to blame, \
But then I watch you sleep, \
I kiss your forehead, \
I bid you a good night, silently, \
I remember, that I forgot, \
That I got annoyed.
